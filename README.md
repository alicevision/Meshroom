# ![Meshroom - 3D Reconstruction Software](/docs/logo/banner-meshroom.png)

[![CII Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/2997/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/2997)

Meshroom is a free, open-source 3D Reconstruction Software based on the [AliceVision](https://github.com/alicevision/AliceVision) Photogrammetric Computer Vision framework.

Learn more details about the pipeline on [AliceVision website](http://alicevision.github.io).

See [results of the pipeline on sketchfab](http://sketchfab.com/AliceVision).

## Photogrammetry

Photogrammetry is the science of making measurements from photographs.
It infers the geometry of a scene from a set of unordered photographs or videos.
Photography is the projection of a 3D scene onto a 2D plane, losing depth information.
The goal of photogrammetry is to reverse this process.

See the [presentation of the pipeline steps](http://alicevision.github.io/#photogrammetry).

## Customization

### Custom Pipelines

You can create custom pipelines in the user interface and save it as template: `File > Advanced > Save As Template`.
You can define the `MESHROOM_PIPELINE_TEMPLATES_PATH` environment variable to specific folders to make these pipelines available in Meshroom.
In a standard precompiled version of Meshroom, you can also directly add custom pipelines in `lib/meshroom/pipelines`.

### Custom Nodes

You can create custom nodes in python and make them available in Meshroom using the `MESHROOM_NODES_PATH` environment variable.
[Here is an example](meshroom/nodes/blender/ScenePreview.py) to launch a Blender rendering from Meshroom.
In a standard precompiled version of Meshroom, you can also directly add custom nodes in `lib/meshroom/nodes`.
To be recognized by Meshroom, a custom folder with nodes should be a Python module (an `__init__.py` file is needed).

### Plugins

Meshroom supports installing containerised plugins via Docker (with the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)) or [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html).

To do so, make sure docker or anaconda is installed properly and available from the command line.
Then click on `File > Advanced > Install Plugin From URL` or `File > Advanced > Install Plugin From Local Folder` to begin the installation.

To learn more about using or creating plugins, check the explanations [here](meshroom/plugins/README.md).

## License

The project is released under MPLv2, see [**COPYING.md**](COPYING.md).

## Get the project

You can [download pre-compiled binaries for the latest release](https://github.com/alicevision/meshroom/releases).  

If you want to build it yourself, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md) to setup the project and pre-requisites.

Get the source code and install runtime requirements:
```bash
git clone --recursive git://github.com/alicevision/meshroom
cd meshroom
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Start Meshroom

You need to have [AliceVision](https://github.com/alicevision/AliceVision) installation in your PATH (and LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux/macOS).

 - __Launch the User Interface__

```bash
# Windows
set PYTHONPATH=%CD% && python meshroom/ui
# Linux/macOS
PYTHONPATH=$PWD python meshroom/ui
```

On Ubuntu, you may have conflicts between native drivers and mesa drivers. In that case, you need to force usage of native drivers by adding them to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/nvidia-340 PYTHONPATH=$PWD python meshroom/ui`
You may need to adjust the folder `/usr/lib/nvidia-340` with the correct driver version.

 - __Launch a 3D reconstruction in command line__

```bash
# Windows: set PYTHONPATH=%CD% &&
# Linux/macOS: PYTHONPATH=$PWD
python bin/meshroom_batch --input INPUT_IMAGES_FOLDER --output OUTPUT_FOLDER
```

## Start Meshroom without building AliceVision

To use Meshroom (ui) without building AliceVision
*   Download a [release](https://github.com/alicevision/meshroom/releases)
*   Checkout corresponding Meshroom (ui) version/tag to avoid versions incompatibilities
*   `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/foo/Meshroom-2023.2.0/aliceVision/lib/ PATH=$PATH:~/foo/Meshroom-2023.2.0/aliceVision/bin/ PYTHONPATH=$PWD python3 meshroom/ui`

## Start and Debug Meshroom in an IDE

PyCharm Community is free IDE which can be used. To start and debug a project with that IDE,
right-click on `Meshroom/ui/__main__.py` > `Debug`, then `Edit Configuration`, in `Environment variables` : 
*   If you want to use aliceVision built by yourself add: `PATH=$PATH:/foo/build/Linux-x86_64/`
*   If you want to use aliceVision release add: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/foo/Meshroom-2023.2.0/aliceVision/lib/;PATH=$PATH:/foo/Meshroom-2023.2.0/aliceVision/bin/` (Make sure that you are on the branch matching the right version)
